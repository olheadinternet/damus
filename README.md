# sideus

A twitter-like [nostr][nostr] client for iPhone, iPad and MacOS. Sideload Build.

[nostr]: https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr


## How to sideload

**Step 1:** Install [altstore](https://altstore.io/) (I recommend following their guides, I invite you to download their Nintendo emulator Delta to make sure you are familiar with the altstore process)

Step 2: download Sideus.ipa to your iOS device grab it from [sideus.app/](https://sideus.app/)

Step 3: 
	- open altstore and go to the My Apps page 
	- click the + in the top left hand corner 
	- browse to your download section and select the downloaded .ipa
	- as long as you're still connected to your computer, the mail app is open and the extension has been loaded properly Sideus should now be side loaded onto your device.
	- Unless you have a developer account, you will need to come back to altstore every 7 days and Refresh with altstore server running on your computer.

Step 4: one tap zap me (don't worry the wallet setting splits still go to will and the damus team for all their work that i just forked and reskinned to allow us to side-load)
